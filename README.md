# Robotic arm for Industrial automation

By Uttam Deshpande et. al.,


We received our Primary Industrial project, which was to build a Robotic Arm that can automate the task of picking, placing, extracting the jobs from and to the CNC machines. The team was grouped into two, one of which was tasked with software (creating code to handle the arm) and another with hardware part of the project. Initially we conducted a survey about different latest technologies and hardware specifications used in the Robotic arms. Following the survey, each team started its work on design and software aspects of the Robotic arm. As per the recommendations of the design team, a scaled-down prototype was created to test the feasibility of the design. The software team was provided a scaled down prototype of the Arm created by the company to test the efficiency of the programming language (Python) and the microcontroller
(Raspberry Pi) to be used. This task was successfully completed. We were also given a chance to put forth our ideas that other than the Robotic arm that can be helpful on the field.
