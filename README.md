# Robotic ARM for Industrial automation

By Uttam Deshpande et. al.,


A Robotic Arm prototype is designed that can automate the task of picking, placing, extracting the jobs from and to the CNC machines. The team was grouped into two, one of which was tasked with software (creating code to handle the arm) and another with hardware part of the project. The prototype of the Arm will help to test the efficiency of the programming logic.
